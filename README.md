        <h3 class="section-title">CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS</h3>
        
        <p>Entity Z-474 operates under <strong>provisional diplomatic immunity</strong> as official ambassador of the extradimensional organization "RedStar Corporation" (Zero Space Industries and Research Labs & Facilities - See Document RS-001). Z-474 has been granted limited Level 4 clearance and unrestricted facility access under Executive Council directive Z-474-DELTA.</p>

        <p>Z-474 is authorized to wear artifact Z-963 as security credential. Standard Z-963 possession protocols are suspended for Z-474 due to <span class="redacted">DATA EXPUNGED</span>. Dr. Jack Bright's consciousness remains active within Z-963 but is unaware of Z-474's control, believing himself to be conducting normal administrative duties. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The amulet worn by Z-474 has been confirmed as an alternate-reality version of Z-963. See Addendum Z-474-B regarding Dr. Bright Identity Paradox.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>CRITICAL DIRECTIVE:</strong> DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CONSUME, BITE, OR INGEST ANY PART OF ENTITY Z-474. See Incident Report Z-474-317 ("Type 5 Diabetes Incident").</p>
        </div>

        <p>Z-474 is to be provided with designated rest areas throughout all facilities due to spontaneous sleep episodes consistent with narcolepsy/hypersomnia. Personnel encountering sleeping Z-474 may relocate entity to safer locations. Entity weighs approximately <span class="redacted">██</span>kg despite diminutive size and can be moved without difficulty during sleep state.</p>

        <p>Z-474 is <strong>NOT</strong> authorized to interact with Z-682, Z-096, Z-106, or any High-Threat entities capable of hostile action without Executive Council approval. See Addendum Z-474-IC regarding "Imaginative Construct" phenomenon and manifestation risks.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Red-Eye Event Protocol</h4>
            <p>In the event Z-474's right eye turns fully red and entity shifts to black coloration with "static" effect, all non-essential personnel are to evacuate the immediate area. Security personnel are authorized to provide support but should not engage unless directly threatened. Red-eye events typically indicate Z-474 is responding to facility threats. Historical data shows Z-474 defends ZSI personnel during such events.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Z-474 is accompanied by Entity Z-474-2 (designated "Zo-e"), a cybernetic companion entity of her own creation. See Section II for complete Z-474-2 documentation.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3 class="section-title">SECTION I: ENTITY Z-474 - "Dr. Z"</h3>

        <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>

        <p>Entity Z-474 is a bipedal anthropomorphic entity approximately 1.2 meters in height, resembling a hybrid of vulpine and lagomorphic features with two distinct tails. The entity refers to itself as "Dr. Z" (full designation: Nakora Jezzika Bae RedStar) and claims to originate from an extradimensional space colloquially known as "The Backrooms," specifically identifying as a "Smiler Entity" (Entity III classification in Backrooms documentation).</p>

        <p>Z-474 self-identifies as CEO/Owner of RedStar Corporation, an inter-reality research conglomerate operating between dimensional layers. Entity claims capability to traverse "flat plains of realities" including dreamscapes, fictional construct universes, and anomalous dimensional spaces.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Physical Characteristics:</h4>
            
            <p><strong>Fur and Thermoregulation:</strong> Z-474's fur is white and possesses thermoregulatory properties similar to polar bear fur, with hollow shaft structures for heat retention despite soft, bunny-like texture. Beneath the fur, skin is dark charcoal gray with faded purple mottling.</p>

            <p><strong>Chromatophore Capabilities:</strong> Entity demonstrates advanced chromatophore capabilities analogous to cephalopod dermal pigmentation, allowing manipulation of skin coloration and emission of bioluminescence. Color shifts correlate with emotional states:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 10px;">
                <li><strong>White (Default):</strong> Calm, neutral, friendly state</li>
                <li><strong>Purple Luminescence:</strong> Cheerful, excited, playful state</li>
                <li><strong>Black with "Static" Effect:</strong> Stressed, combat-ready, defensive state</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Ocular Features:</strong> Z-474 possesses heterochromic eyes with distinct functional properties:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 10px;">
                <li><strong>Right Eye (Red):</strong> Becomes fully red when entity is angered or utilizing enhanced perception. Associated with "Red Eye Events."</li>
                <li><strong>Left Eye (Violet):</strong> Default state, associated with calm demeanor.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES</h4>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>1. Telepathic Communication</h4>
            <p>Z-474 demonstrates short-range telepathy (approximately 15-meter radius). Subjects report the experience as "conversational" rather than intrusive. Entity possesses universal language comprehension and translation capabilities, though entity reports preference for American English. Entity's communication exhibits a subtle, mysterious rhyming quality that personnel find "oddly charming" and "hypnotic in nature, a dance of words with clever flair."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>2. Telekinesis</h4>
            <p>Z-474 can manipulate objects and achieve self-levitation through localized gravitational manipulation. Maximum weight capacity unknown; entity claims to significantly "hold back" strength capabilities. During Incident Z-474-09, Z-474 lifted and relocated an object weighing approximately <span class="redacted">████</span>kg with apparent ease.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>3. Enhanced Perception ("Third Eye")</h4>
            <p>Z-474's right (red) eye provides perception capabilities beyond human baseline, including:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 10px;">
                <li>Direct observation of peripheral-dependent entities without triggering defensive responses</li>
                <li>Visual lock through closed eyelids via "internal third eye"</li>
                <li>Multi-dimensional sensory input without cognitive distress</li>
                <li>Long-range awareness of events occurring <span class="redacted">DATA EXPUNGED</span> rooms away</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>4. Z-963 Immunity</h4>
            <p>Z-474 is the first documented case of an entity wearing Z-963 without experiencing personality override or consciousness displacement. Entity describes its mind as "too strong to be taken over, you see! A fortress of thought that remains uniquely me!" Mechanism unknown and requires further study.</p>
            <p><strong>CRITICAL NOTE:</strong> The amulet worn by Z-474 has been identified as an alternate-reality version of Z-963, not the baseline artifact. See Addendum Z-474-B for details on Dr. Bright Identity Paradox.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>5. Imaginative Construct Creation</h4>
            <p>Z-474 possesses an unconscious, uncontrolled ability to create "playful counterparts" or "imaginative constructs" of entities it becomes "fond of" or perceives as "misunderstood." Manifestation occurs subconsciously; Z-474 has NO conscious control. See Entity Z-474-1 documentation for detailed information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>6. Reality Navigation</h4>
            <p>Z-474 claims capability to traverse multiple dimensional layers with "dreamlike, lucid-walking flair." Entity has demonstrated knowledge of and access to anomalous dimensional passages, including connections between The Backrooms, ZSI facility corridors, dreamscapes, and fictional construct realities.</p>
        </div>

            <strong>Threat Level:</strong> Critical</p>

            <p>During simultaneous containment breach, Z-474's right eye turned fully red with immediate shift to black coloration exhibiting "static" effect. Entity engaged hostile entity through telepathic means described by surviving personnel as "a voice that shook the very air, commanding with authority beyond compare." Z-474 physically interposed itself between threat and three cornered researchers.</p>

            <p><strong>Casualties:</strong> 0 (Zero) among personnel in Z-474's immediate area</p>

            <p><strong>Post-Incident:</strong> Z-474 returned to white coloration and fell asleep in hallway. Upon waking, entity had no memory of specific events during Red Eye state.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">EXECUTIVE COUNCIL ASSESSMENT</h3>

        <p><strong>Council Member-7:</strong> <em>This entity is either the most dangerous thing we've allowed to walk freely through our facilities, or our most valuable potential ally. Possibly both. The fact that it wears another entity as an access badge while creating helpful manifestations throughout the facility is unprecedented. Observation continues.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Council Member-14:</strong> <em>Dr. Z has fundamentally challenged our approach to entity management. The entity treats subjects as individuals deserving dignity rather than threats requiring containment. While this perspective seems naive, the entity has survived the Backrooms and maintains genuine connections with entities we consider hostile. Perhaps there's something to learn here.</em></p>

        <h3 class="section-title">MEMORABLE QUOTES</h3>

        <p><strong>From Z-474:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>"Containment? Oh no, I'm free to explore and roam! I'm an ambassador, this is like a second home!"</em></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>"Everyone deserves kindness, even from one like me! That includes the ones you think are scary, you see!"</em></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>"Reality doesn't work the way you all think with glee! In the Backrooms, things exist in states of quantum mystery!"</em></p>

        <p><strong>From Z-474-2 (Zo-e):</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>"I'm not an AI! I'm alive! Dr. Z gave me freedom when she gave me life to thrive!"</em></p>

        <p><strong>From Dr. Bright:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>"Which me is me? This is worse than the time I got stuck in the femur, you see?"</em></p>
